an IRC bot written in bash

features -------------------------------------

- libera.chat services integration
- administrative commands
- fun commands
- spaghetti code. lots and lots.
- easy to extend, since it's written in bash.
- quite light, coming in at ~250 SLOC
- easy to run on more than 1 channel

installation ---------------------------------

to install sblorgo, you first need to get the
dependencies, which are:
- bash (duh!)
- ii
- tput
- sed
- awk
after you've installed all that, clone this
repo and edit sblorgo.sh and start.sh to your
liking. after that, open up a terminal and
run start.sh, then open another terminal and
run sblorgo.sh in it.

as of now, it's just jornmann. if you'd like
to change that, I'd be forever grateful :D
however, there is a list of requirements:
- make sure that you can work with messy code.
- make sure you can write bash scripts.
- make sure you follow the other requirements.
yep, that's it. your contributions will be
